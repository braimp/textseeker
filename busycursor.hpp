/*!
 * \class BusyCursor
 * \brief Block application with a busy cursor.
 * This was a cheap and probably really bad way to disable ui response while
 * the application loads indexes or views from files.  You basically create an
 * instance of BusyCursor when you want to block ui, and often this is done
 * in a scoped block along with the function that does the long term or
 * blocking operation.  In reality, I want to replace these load functions
 * with dispatch threads that do loading and parsing without blocking Qt ui
 * functionality, and then have them signal updates to main when they complete.
 * That will happen in a future release making this obsolete.
